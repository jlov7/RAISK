# Teacher Pre-Deployment Checklist for AI Tools

**Use this checklist before introducing any AI tool in your classroom**

> **Disclaimer**: This checklist provides informational guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. Consult your school's legal counsel, IT department, and administration for compliance with FERPA, COPPA, and applicable state laws.

---

## Part 1: Legal and Privacy Compliance

### Student Privacy Assessment

- [ ] **Reviewed the tool's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy**
  - Where is student data stored? (U.S., EU, other?)
  - How long is data retained?
  - Is data used to train future AI models?
  - Is data shared with third parties?

- [ ] **Verified age-appropriateness**
  - For students under 13: Tool is COPPA-compliant (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506)
  - Tool does not collect personal information from minors without verifiable parental consent
  - School has appropriate data protection agreements in place
  - **Note**: COPPA rules were updated in 2025; see [FTC COPPA guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/childrens-privacy)

- [ ] **Checked FERPA compliance** (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g)
  - Tool provider qualifies as a "school official" under FERPA OR parental consent obtained
  - Student records (grades, attendance, assignments) are not shared without authorization
  - Parents have right to access and challenge data collected
  - **Resources**: [U.S. Dept. of Education FERPA guidance](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/)

- [ ] **Obtained necessary approvals**
  - School IT department has reviewed and approved the tool
  - Administration is aware of the tool and its use case
  - Parental consent forms distributed and collected (if required)

- [ ] **Created opt-out alternatives**
  - Alternative assignments available for students who cannot or will not use AI
  - Non-AI options are equivalent in learning value and workload
  - Students will not be penalized for choosing the non-AI option

### Data Minimization

- [ ] **Limit data collection**
  - Students do not need to provide real names, birthdates, or contact information
  - Pseudonyms or student IDs used instead of full names where possible
  - Students instructed never to share personal or family information in prompts

- [ ] **Use school-managed accounts**
  - Students use school-provided email addresses, not personal accounts
  - School has administrator access to monitor and delete student data if needed
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) or rostered accounts used to avoid repeated data entry

---

## Part 2: Pedagogical Fit and Assessment Design

### Learning Goals Alignment

- [ ] **Defined clear educational purpose**
  - I can explain how this tool supports specific learning objectives
  - The tool enhances learning; it does not replace critical thinking or skill-building
  - I have considered whether traditional methods might be equally or more effective

- [ ] **Identified appropriate use cases**
  - Students will use AI for [brainstorming / drafting / editing / research / translation / coding assistance / other: ________________]
  - Students will NOT use AI for [final submissions / exams / graded work without citation / other: ________________]
  - I have communicated these boundaries clearly in writing (syllabus, assignment instructions)

### Assignment and Assessment Redesign

- [ ] **Designed AI-resistant assignments** (choose what applies)
  - Process-based: Require outlines, drafts, peer feedback, and reflections
  - Personalized: Tied to class discussions, local events, or student experiences
  - Multimodal: Include in-class presentations, discussions, or hands-on demonstrations
  - Metacognitive: Ask students to reflect on their learning process and struggles

- [ ] **Created clear rubrics**
  - Rubric assesses thinking process, originality, and understanding—not just final product
  - Points allocated for showing work, citing sources, and explaining reasoning
  - Criteria for AI-assisted work clearly defined (if allowed)

- [ ] **Increased in-class assessment weight** (if appropriate)
  - In-class essays, quizzes, or presentations where AI assistance is limited
  - Oral exams or one-on-one discussions to verify understanding
  - Balance of take-home and in-class work to assess true skill level

### Academic Integrity Safeguards

- [ ] **Established an AI use policy**
  - Policy specifies when AI is allowed, prohibited, or requires citation
  - Policy includes examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable use
  - Consequences for violations are clearly stated and aligned with school policy

- [ ] **Taught citation practices for AI**
  - Students know how to document AI assistance (e.g., "I used ChatGPT to brainstorm thesis ideas")
  - Expectations for level of detail in AI citations are clear
  - Sample citations provided in assignment instructions

- [ ] **Prepared to detect and address misuse**
  - I understand the limitations of AI detection tools (high false positive rates)
  - I know how to have a respectful conversation with a student I suspect of misuse
  - I will focus on learning and improvement, not just punishment

## Part 3: Equity and Accessibility

### Access and Equity

- [ ] **Verified equitable access**
  - All students have access to devices and internet needed to use the tool
  - Students who lack home internet can complete AI-assisted work during school hours
  - Alternatives are available for students with limited access

- [ ] **Considered language and cultural barriers**
  - Tool supports languages spoken by students in my class (if relevant)
  - AI-generated content will be reviewed for cultural sensitivity and bias
  - I will explicitly teach students to question AI outputs for bias

### Accessibility for Students with Disabilities

- [ ] **Checked accessibility features**
  - Tool is compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies
  - Captions, transcripts, or text alternatives are available for AI-generated audio/video
  - Tool meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, if possible

- [ ] **Consulted with special education staff** (if applicable)
  - IEP or 504 accommodations are compatible with AI tool use
  - AI tool supports (or does not interfere with) assistive technologies already in use

---

## Part 4: Teaching Responsible AI Literacy

### Student Preparation

- [ ] **Planned an introductory lesson on AI**
  - Explain what GenAI is and how it works (in age-appropriate terms)
  - Discuss limitations: hallucinations, bias, privacy risks
  - Demonstrate examples of when AI is helpful vs. when it leads students astray

- [ ] **Incorporated critical thinking exercises**
  - Students will practice fact-checking AI outputs
  - Students will analyze AI-generated content for bias or missing perspectives
  - Students will compare AI-assisted work to their own independent work

- [ ] **Created opportunities for reflection**
  - Students will reflect on how AI helped or hindered their learning
  - Students will discuss ethical dilemmas related to AI use
  - Students will share strategies for using AI responsibly

### Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustment

- [ ] **Set up a feedback loop**
  - I will survey students about their AI tool experience mid-term
  - I will adjust policies or assignments based on observed misuse or confusion
  - I will share insights with colleagues to improve school-wide practices

- [ ] **Committed to staying informed**
  - I will follow updates to the tool's privacy policy or terms of service
  - I will participate in professional development on AI in education
  - I will revisit this checklist annually or when adopting new tools

  - What portion of the work was AI-assisted vs. student-generated

### Consequences for Violations
- [ ] First offense: [Redo assignment / Point deduction / Warning / Other: ________________]
- [ ] Repeated offenses: [Academic integrity referral / Failure on assignment / Other: ________________]
- [ ] Policy aligns with school-wide academic integrity procedures

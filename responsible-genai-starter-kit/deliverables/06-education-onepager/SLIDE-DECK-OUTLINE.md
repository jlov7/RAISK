## Slide 2: What Is Generative AI?

**Headline**: GenAI: The Technology Shaping the Future of Work and Learning

**Content**:
- **Definition**: AI tools that create new content (text, images, code, audio) based on patterns learned from massive datasets
- **Popular examples**:
  - ChatGPT, Google Gemini (text generation)
  - DALL-E, Midjourney (image creation)
  - GitHub Copilot (code assistance)
- **How it works** (simplified): Predicts the next word, pixel, or line of code based on what it has seen before—not true understanding

**[Image suggestion]**: Simple diagram showing "User Prompt → AI Model → Generated Output" with icons

**Speaker Notes**:
- Emphasize that GenAI is probabilistic, not factual—it guesses what sounds right, but can be wrong
- Students already have access to these tools, whether we permit them in class or not
- Our job is to teach responsible use, not ignore the technology

## Slide 3: Why This Matters Now

**Headline**: Students Are Already Using AI—With or Without Guidance

**Content**:
- **Student usage statistics** (cite recent studies if available):
  - [X]% of students have used ChatGPT for homework
  - AI tools are free, accessible 24/7, and require no specialized training
- **Workplace reality**: AI skills are increasingly expected in careers across all sectors
- **The educator's dilemma**: Ban it and drive use underground, or teach responsible use and prepare students for the future

**[Image suggestion]**: Photo of diverse students using laptops/tablets in a classroom setting

**Speaker Notes**:
- Share anecdotes if you have them (e.g., "I surveyed my class, and 70% had already tried ChatGPT")
- Acknowledge the discomfort many educators feel about AI disrupting traditional teaching
- Frame this as an opportunity: We can shape how students think about AI ethics and responsibility

## Slide 4: Key Risks Educators Must Understand

**Headline**: Four Critical Risks of AI in Education

**Content**:
1. **Academic Integrity**: Students submitting AI-generated work as their own, bypassing the learning process
2. **Privacy & Data Security**: Student data stored, analyzed, or exposed by AI companies (FERPA/COPPA concerns)
3. **Bias & Misinformation**: AI outputs reflect historical biases and can confidently state false information ("hallucinations")
4. **Over-Reliance**: Students lose critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills if they depend on AI

**[Image suggestion]**: Four-quadrant infographic with icons for each risk

**Speaker Notes**:
- Reference NIST AI 600-1 (Generative AI Profile) which identifies these as core risk categories
- Provide a brief example for each:
  - Academic integrity: Student who copied an entire essay from ChatGPT
  - Privacy: Free AI tool that stores student prompts indefinitely and uses them to train future models
  - Bias: Image generator that depicts all scientists as white men
  - Over-reliance: Student who cannot write a paragraph without AI assistance

## Slide 5: Privacy and Legal Compliance

**Headline**: Protecting Student Data: FERPA, COPPA, and Vendor Agreements

**Content**:
- **FERPA** (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act): Schools must protect student education records
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act): Strict rules for collecting data from students under 13
- **Best practices**:
  - Review Terms of Service and Privacy Policies before adopting any tool
  - Use school-managed accounts (not personal student emails)
  - Ensure vendors have Student Data Privacy Agreements (DPAs)
  - Teach students never to share personal information in AI prompts

**[Image suggestion]**: Icon checklist with "Privacy Policy ✓", "Data Agreement ✓", "School Accounts ✓"

**Speaker Notes**:
- Explain that many free AI tools (like ChatGPT) store user inputs to improve their models—this is a privacy risk
- Schools can be held liable for privacy violations, so it is essential to vet tools before use
- Mention that some AI companies now offer "education" or "enterprise" versions with stronger privacy protections
- Reference the Teacher Checklist (included in this toolkit) for a step-by-step privacy review process

## Slide 6: Redesigning Assignments for the AI Era

**Headline**: AI-Resistant Assessment: Focus on Process, Not Just Product

**Content**:
- **Old approach**: "Write a 5-page essay on X" → AI can generate this in seconds
- **New approach**: Assess the learning process
  - Require outlines, drafts, peer reviews, reflections
  - Ask personalized questions tied to class discussions or local context
  - Increase weight of in-class work (presentations, discussions, exams)
  - Use metacognitive questions: "What did you struggle with? How did your thinking change?"

**[Image suggestion]**: Side-by-side comparison of "Old Assignment" vs. "AI-Resistant Assignment" with checkmarks and examples

**Speaker Notes**:
- Emphasize that the goal is not to "catch" students, but to design assignments where using AI without understanding is ineffective
- Example: Instead of "Summarize this historical event," ask "Based on our class discussion, which cause was most significant and why? Include a reflection on how your thinking evolved."
- Process-based grading reduces the incentive to cheat because students must show their work at every stage

---

## Slide 7: Teaching AI Literacy and Critical Thinking

**Headline**: Empower Students to Question, Verify, and Think Critically

**Content**:
- **Teach students to interrogate AI outputs**:
  - "Is this information accurate? How can I verify it?"
  - "What perspectives or voices are missing?"
  - "Who created this AI, and what biases might it have?"
- **Hands-on activities**:
  - Fact-check an AI response using credible sources
  - Detect bias in AI-generated images or text
  - Experiment with prompt engineering and observe how outputs change
  - Identify tasks AI cannot do well (moral reasoning, local knowledge, creativity)

**[Image suggestion]**: Photo of teacher and students gathered around a screen, analyzing AI output together

**Speaker Notes**:
- AI literacy is a life skill—students will encounter AI in their careers, civic life, and personal decisions
- By teaching critical thinking about AI, we prepare students to be informed citizens and responsible users
- Share an example activity: "I had students ask ChatGPT about a local historical event. It made up facts because it lacked local knowledge. This led to a great discussion about AI limitations."

## Slide 8: Creating a Transparent AI Use Policy

**Headline**: Set Clear Expectations: When, How, and Why to Use AI

**Content**:
- **Policy components**:
  - **When AI is allowed**: Brainstorming, outlining, grammar checking
  - **When AI is prohibited**: Final drafts (without citation), exams, graded code
  - **Citation requirements**: Students must disclose AI use and how it helped them
  - **Consequences**: Aligned with academic integrity policy (redo, point deduction, referral)
- **Involve students**: Ask for their input to increase buy-in
- **Post policy clearly**: Syllabus, LMS, assignment instructions

**[Image suggestion]**: Sample policy excerpt in a clean, easy-to-read format

**Speaker Notes**:
- Transparency is key—students respond better to clear rules than vague prohibitions
- Explain the "why" behind the policy: "The goal is learning, not just getting the right answer."
- Acknowledge that enforcing this is challenging, but clear policies help students make better choices
- Reference the Teacher Checklist and Classroom Guardrails documents for policy templates

## Slide 9: Equity, Access, and Inclusion

**Headline**: Ensuring AI Benefits All Students

**Content**:
- **Access barriers**:
  - Not all students have reliable internet or devices at home
  - AI tools may not support all languages or cultural contexts
  - Students with disabilities may face accessibility challenges
- **Equity strategies**:
  - Provide in-class time for AI-assisted work
  - Offer non-AI alternatives that meet the same learning goals
  - Verify tools are compatible with assistive technologies (screen readers, captions)
  - Teach students to recognize and critique bias in AI outputs

**[Image suggestion]**: Diverse group of students using different devices and accessibility tools

**Speaker Notes**:
- AI can either widen or close achievement gaps, depending on how we implement it
- Students from under-resourced backgrounds may lack access to premium AI tools or tutoring
- Students with disabilities benefit from AI (e.g., speech-to-text, translation) but only if tools are designed accessibly
- Culturally, AI-generated content often reflects Western, English-centric biases—teach students to notice and critique this

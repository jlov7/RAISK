**[SCHOOL LETTERHEAD]**

**Date**: [Insert Date]

**To**: Parents and Guardians of [Class/Grade Level]

**From**: [Teacher Name / Department / School Administration]

**Re**: Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools in [Class Name/Subject]

---

Dear Parents and Guardians,

We are writing to inform you about how our school is using artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the classroom and to answer questions you may have about student privacy, safety, and learning.

## What Are AI Tools and Why Are We Using Them?

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are computer programs that can generate text, images, or other content based on instructions. You may have heard of tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or DALL-E. These tools are becoming common in workplaces and schools, and our goal is to teach students how to use them responsibly.

**In [Class Name], students will use AI for**:
- [ ] Brainstorming ideas and creating outlines
- [ ] Getting feedback on grammar and writing style
- [ ] Generating practice questions for study
- [ ] Creating visual aids for presentations
- [ ] Learning about AI technology and its societal impact
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

**Students will NOT use AI for**:
- [ ] Completing final essays or projects without their own thinking
- [ ] Taking exams or quizzes
- [ ] Submitting work they do not understand
- [ ] Any task where independent learning is the primary goal

Our focus is on teaching students to use AI as a tool to support their learning, not replace it. We want students to develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills that AI cannot provide.

## What Tools Are We Using?

**Tool Name(s)**: [Insert specific AI tools, e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard, Khan Academy's AI tutor]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of how each tool will be used in the classroom]

**Age Appropriateness**: [Confirm tools are appropriate for student age group and comply with COPPA if students are under 13]

---

## What Data Is Collected and How Is It Protected?

We take student privacy very seriously. Here is what you need to know:

### What Information Is Collected?
- [ ] **No personal information**: Students will use the tool anonymously or with pseudonyms
- [ ] **School email addresses only**: Students will log in with school-provided accounts (not personal accounts)
- [ ] **Assignments and prompts**: The tool may store text or images that students input
- [ ] **Other data**: [Specify any other data collected, such as usage logs]

### How Is Data Stored and Used?
- **Data storage location**: [e.g., United States, European Union, cloud-based servers]
- **Data retention**: [e.g., Data is stored for the duration of the school year, then deleted]
- **Training AI models**: [Yes / No - Does the company use student input to improve its AI?]
- **Third-party sharing**: [Yes / No - Specify if data is shared with advertisers, researchers, etc.]

### Legal Protections
- **FERPA compliance**: [Explain how the tool complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]
- **COPPA compliance** (for students under 13): [Confirm compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]
- **Student Data Privacy Agreement**: [Indicate if the school has a data protection agreement with the vendor]

### What We Are Doing to Protect Privacy
- Students are instructed never to share personal information (names, addresses, phone numbers, family details) in AI prompts
- Students use school-managed accounts with administrator oversight
- We review the tool's privacy policy regularly and discontinue use if policies change in unacceptable ways
- [Add any other safeguards your school has in place]

## How Are We Ensuring Academic Integrity?

We have established clear guidelines to prevent students from misusing AI to cheat or avoid learning:

### Classroom Policy
- Students must cite any AI assistance in their assignments (e.g., "I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for this outline")
- AI-generated content must be reviewed, edited, and understood by the student before submission
- Students will be assessed on their thinking process, not just the final product (e.g., through drafts, outlines, and reflections)
- Misuse of AI in violation of academic integrity policies will result in [consequences aligned with school policy]

### What We Are Teaching
- How to recognize when AI produces incorrect or biased information
- How to fact-check AI outputs using credible sources
- When AI is helpful vs. when it interferes with learning
- Ethical considerations around AI use in school and society

---

## How Are We Addressing Bias and Misinformation?

AI tools are not perfect. They can produce inaccurate information, reflect societal biases, or provide culturally insensitive content. We are teaching students to:

- **Question AI outputs**: "Is this information correct? How do I know?"
- **Recognize bias**: "Whose perspective is included? Whose is missing?"
- **Verify facts**: "Can I find credible sources to confirm this?"

Critical thinking and media literacy are core components of our curriculum, and AI provides a valuable opportunity to practice these skills.

## Your Rights and How to Opt Out

### You Have the Right To:
- **Review data**: Request to see what data has been collected about your child
- **Request deletion**: Ask that your child's data be removed from the AI tool's systems
- **Opt out**: Decline permission for your child to use AI tools in the classroom

### If You Choose to Opt Out:
- Your child will be provided with alternative assignments that meet the same learning objectives
- Your child will not be penalized academically for opting out
- [Explain the process for opting out, e.g., "Please complete and return the attached form by [date]"]

### How to Reach Us with Questions or Concerns:

## Talking to Your Child About AI

You can support your child's learning by discussing AI at home:

**Ask Open-Ended Questions**:
- "Are you using any AI tools in school? What are they helping you with?"
- "What do you like about AI? What frustrates you?"
- "Have you noticed AI making mistakes or saying something that seemed wrong?"

**Encourage Healthy Habits**:
- Remind your child to think independently before turning to AI for help
- Talk about privacy: What information is safe to share online, and what should stay private?
- Discuss the difference between using AI as a helpful tool vs. relying on it to avoid learning

**Model Responsible Use**:
- If you use AI tools at work or home, share your experiences with your child
- Demonstrate critical thinking: "This AI-generated email sounds good, but let me double-check the facts."

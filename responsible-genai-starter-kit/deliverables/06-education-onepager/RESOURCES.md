## AI Detection and Academic Integrity

### Important Note on AI Detection Tools
AI detection tools (e.g., Turnitin AI detector, GPTZero) have high false positive rates and should **never** be used as sole evidence of academic misconduct. They can incorrectly flag work by:
- Non-native English speakers
- Students with certain writing styles
- Students using grammar-checking tools

**Recommendation**: Use detection tools as a conversation starter, not as proof. Focus on process-based assessment instead.

### Resources on AI Detection Limitations

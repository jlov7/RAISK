**Production-ready toolkit for building responsible generative AI systems aligned to U.S. federal guidance.**

This open-source starter kit provides checklists, evaluation harnesses, CI/CD workflows, and educational resources grounded in:
- **NIST AI 600-1** (Generative AI Profile, July 2024)
- **NIST AI RMF Playbook** (AI Risk Management Framework implementation)
- **NIST SP 800-218A** (Secure Software Development Framework for GenAI & dual-use foundation models)
- **C2PA v2.2** (Content Provenance and Authenticity)

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/responsible-genai-starter-kit.git
cd responsible-genai-starter-kit

# Install dependencies (Python example)
cd deliverables/02-eval-harness
pip install -e .

# Run sample evaluation
eval-harness run \
  --dataset examples/qa_dataset.csv \
  --scorers exact_match,length

# Sign content with C2PA
cd ../04-c2pa-provenance-demo
npm install
npm run build
npm run sign -- -i examples/images/photo.jpg -o examples/images/photo-signed.jpg -c examples/certs/dev-certificate.pem -k examples/certs/dev-private-key.pem --title "Demo" --ai-generated
npm run verify -- -i examples/images/photo-signed.jpg --detailed
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Supply Chain

All releases include:
- **SBOMs** (SPDX and CycloneDX formats) via Syft and cdxgen
- **SLSA v1.0 L3 provenance** via slsa-github-generator + GitHub Artifact Attestations
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** weekly scans
- **CodeQL** static analysis
- **Evaluation quality gates** blocking releases unless thresholds met (NIST AI RMF MEASURE/MANAGE)

**Supply chain verification:**
```bash
# Verify SLSA provenance (requires slsa-verifier)
slsa-verifier verify-artifact release.tar.gz \
  --provenance-path provenance.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/yourusername/responsible-genai-starter-kit
```

# Granting full permissions to Claude Code (2025-10-02 13:14Z)

_**User (2025-10-02 22:52Z)**_

I'm trying to give Claude Code full permissions but this is giving me an error?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've fixed the JSON syntax. The environment variable is now properly formatted as a string in the array. The `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_APPROVE_BASH=true` setting will give Claude Code the ability to run bash commands automatically without asking for approval each time.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! No linter errors, so the JSON is now valid. The fix should resolve the user's issue with Claude Code permissions.


## Resolving JSON Issue  
- Found that the user's JSON in Cursor settings had invalid syntax, causing an error.</details></think>

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The problem was with the JSON syntax in your Cursor settings. You had:

```json
"claude-code.environmentVariables": [
    export CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_APPROVE_BASH=true
]
```

But in JSON, environment variables need to be strings, not shell commands. I've corrected it to:

```json
"claude-code.environmentVariables": [
    "CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_APPROVE_BASH=true"
]
```

The `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_APPROVE_BASH=true` environment variable gives Claude Code full permissions to run bash commands automatically without asking for your approval each time. You'll need to restart Cursor for this change to take effect.

No linter errors remain, so your settings should now be valid!
